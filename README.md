# Monitoring

Monitoring servers using Riemann, Graphite &amp; Grafana

## What is monitoring?

Tools and processes by which you measure and manage your IT systems.

## Benefits of monitoring

  * To detect, diagnose and help resolve faults and other issues in your technology environment

  * To understand current state of our product and make technology decisions, and measures the success of those projects

    - Example: Your marketing team might decide to increase their spend in advertisement

## What are different stages of monitoring?

### Manual, user-initiated, or no monitoring

  * It’s commonly managed via checklists, simple scripts, and other non-automated processes

  * Only components which are broken in past being monitored

  * Here the focus be mainly to minimize downtime

  * It provides little or no value in measuring quality or service and provides little or no data that helps IT justify budgets, costs, or new projects

  * Its common in small organizations with limited IT staffing

### Reactive

  * Automated with some remnants of manual or unmonitored components

  * You will commonly see tools like Nagios with stock checks of basic concerns like disk, CPU and memory

  * Alerting will be based on simple thresholds and sent via email or slack or other messaging services

  * This focuses on measuring availability and managing IT assets

  * It provides some data that measures quality of service and also helps IT justify budgets, costs or new projects

  * Most of the data needs to be manipulated or transformed before it can be used

  * Small number of operationally focused dashboards exist

  * Its common in small to medium sized organizations

### Proactive

  * Considered core to managing infrastructure and the business

  * Monitoring is automatic and generated by configuration management

  * You’ll see tools like Nagios, Sensu, and Graphite with widespread use of metrics

  * Checks will be application centric, with many applications instrumented as part of development

  * Checks will focus on measuring application performance and business outcomes rather than just stock concerns like disk and CPU

  * Performance data will be collected and used frequently for analysis and fault resolution

  * Focus is on measuring quality of service and customer experience

  * Data collected is provided directly to business units, application teams and other relevant parties via dashboards and reports

  * This is common in organization that have adopted a DevOps culture

  * Monitoring will be managed by an operational team but responsibility for ensuring new applications and services to be monitored may be delegated to developers

  * Product is not considered feature complete or ready for deployment without monitoring
